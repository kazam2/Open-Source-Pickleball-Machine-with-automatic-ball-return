Pickleball throwing machine with automatic ball return, 3D printable design, Arduino-controlled, automatic ball return mechanism  Features include adjustable speed/spin control, modular construction, and low target build cost. Controlled via bluetooth app on iphone

⚠️ THIS IS AN INTEREST VALIDATION PHASE ⚠️

I've built a working prototype and now need your help deciding: Should I invest 100+ hours to create complete open-source documentation?
The machine works. Now I need to know: Are people interested in building it?

✨ Key Features (Prototype Complete)

✅ Automatic Ball Return - Self-contained collection and feeding system
✅ Adjustable Shots - Control speed, spin, and trajectory
✅ DIY-Friendly - Primarily 3D printed + comercially available components
✅ Cost-Effective - Target build cost less than $300 + nets
✅ Open-Source Electronics - Arduino-based control system

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How much will it cost to build?
A: Preliminary estimate: $250-$350 depending on parts sourcing + nets

Q: What skills are needed?
A: Basic 3D printing, simple wiring/assembly, and following instructions.

Q: When will complete plans be ready?
A: If we reach our interest goal (100+ builders), within 1-2 months.

Q: Can I help with the project?
A: Yes! Mention your skills in the interest form or start a Discussion.

Q: Why not just release everything now?
A: Creating quality documentation takes 100+ hours. I need to know if it's worth that investment for the community.
